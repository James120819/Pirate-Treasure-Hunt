# Pirate-Treasure-Hunt
Pirate Treasure Hunt Project

Reflection

This project focused on building an intelligent agent using reinforcement learning to solve a maze based Pirate Treasure Hunt game. The goal was to train the AI pirate to find the treasure efficiently by learning from rewards and penalties.I was provided with starter code that set up the maze environment and base functions. I created and modified the Q training function that helped the pirate agent learn over time. I also adjusted parameters like learning rate, exploration, and memory to improve training results.This project showed me how computer scientists use algorithms to teach computers to learn from experience. It connects to the larger field by demonstrating how AI can be used to make systems smarter and more efficient in solving real world problems.

What Computer Scientists Do And Why? 
Computer scientists design, build, and improve software and algorithms that power technology. Their work matters because it drives progress in automation, AI, data analysis, and problem solving across every industry.

How Do You Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist? 
I’ve learned to approach problems step by step breaking them down, testing solutions, and adjusting based on results. Debugging and experimentation helped me understand that problem solving in computer science is about continuous improvement.


What Are my Ethical Responsibilities To The End User And The Organization? 
My ethical responsibilities include protecting user data, ensuring fairness, and creating systems that are safe and transparent. In AI projects, it’s important to avoid bias, respect privacy, and make technology that benefits people.
